# Privacy Policy for Orbitica Core

**Last Updated: November 12, 2025**

## Introduction

This Privacy Policy describes how Orbitica Core ("we", "our", or "the app") collects, uses, and protects your information when you use our mobile application.

## Information We Collect

### Data Collected
Orbitica Core collects only the following minimal data:

1. **Device Identifier (UID)**: A unique device identifier provided by your device
2. **High Score**: Your highest game score

### Purpose of Collection
This data is collected solely for the purpose of maintaining a **global leaderboard** that allows players to compare their scores with others worldwide.

## Data We DO NOT Collect

We do **not** collect:
- Personal identifying information (name, email, phone number, address)
- Location data
- Photos, videos, or media files
- Contacts or calendar information
- Financial or payment information
- Health or fitness data
- Browsing history or search history
- Device logs or crash reports containing personal information
- Any other data beyond the device UID and high score

## How We Use Your Information

The collected data is used exclusively to:
- Display your score on the global leaderboard
- Maintain leaderboard rankings
- Identify unique players without collecting personal information

## Data Storage and Security

- Data is stored securely on our servers
- Device UIDs are anonymized and cannot be traced back to individual users
- We implement industry-standard security measures to protect your data
- No third parties have access to your data

## Data Sharing

We do **not**:
- Sell your data to third parties
- Share your data with advertisers
- Use your data for marketing purposes
- Share your data with analytics companies

The only "sharing" that occurs is the public display of scores on the global leaderboard, which shows only:
- Your score
- An anonymized player identifier (not your device UID)

## Children's Privacy

Orbitica Core does not knowingly collect information from children under the age of 13. The game is suitable for all ages, and the minimal data we collect (device UID and score) does not constitute personal information that would require parental consent under COPPA.

## Your Rights

You have the right to:
- **Access**: Request information about the data we store about your device
- **Deletion**: Request deletion of your score and device UID from our leaderboard
- **Opt-out**: Stop playing the game to prevent further data collection

- If you request deletion, your data will be removed from our servers within 30 days

## Changes to This Privacy Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify users of any material changes by:
- Updating the "Last Updated" date at the top of this policy
- Displaying a notification in the app (for significant changes)

## Third-Party Services

Orbitica Core does not integrate with any third-party services, analytics platforms, or advertising networks.

## International Data Transfers

Your data may be stored on servers located in different countries. By using the app, you consent to the transfer of your minimal data (device UID and score) to these servers.
